# Logic Gates Playground

This is a virtual, in-browser logic gates simulator. It supports all the standard logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, XOR, etc.) and also has inputs, outputs, and a 4-bit 7-segment display. It also supports exporting/importing circuits. It can be used to learn about the basics of digital logic and experiment with logic gate circuits.

# How to use

Click on a logic gate on the top to add it to the circuit builder interface. Then, drag and drop where to want to, and click on an output connector (on the right), then on a input connector on a different gate to connect it. Also take a look at the default example circuit that appears when you just open the website.

# Random Notes

- Debugging this was really annoying/hard... I think I might need a break from JavaScript soon (and especially React)
- The "ui" folder has something like a flowchart interface that I might separate out later because it could be useful for other stuff as well
